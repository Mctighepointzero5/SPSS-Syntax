*The code here was used to reduce reaction time data from a lab experiment. 
**TXT files containing several thousand cells are compiled into 6 meaningful bits of data. 
***This code was run on 129 TXT files as part of my Master's Thesis 

*STEP 1 - IMPORT TXT FILE.
*This first section of code would call the txt file from the working directory and label the collumns in a uniform way

*STEP 2 - COLLECT frequency correct
*This simple code collected frequency scores for correct responses on the attentiion task
FREQUENCIES VARIABLES=accuracy
  /ORDER=ANALYSIS.







*STEP 3 omit problematic data. 
**All incorrect responses were omitted as wel as reponses above or below criteria established in the literature. 

*Set error trials to missing. 
DO IF (accuracy = "E").
RECODE reaction (ELSE=SYSMIS).
END IF.
EXECUTE.

*Set fast outliers to missing.
DO IF (reaction < 200).
Recode reaction (ELSE=SYSMIS).
END IF.
EXECUTE.

*Set slow outliers to missing.
DO IF (reaction > 1000).
Recode reaction (ELSE=SYSMIS).
END IF.
EXECUTE.






*STEP 4 GET STATISTICS
** These code would aggreate reaction time data that will be used to test order effects and cue validity effects.

*order effect data.
